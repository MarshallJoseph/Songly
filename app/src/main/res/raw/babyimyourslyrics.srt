1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,000
I thought I had it all together

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But I was led astray The day you walked away

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You were the clock that was ticking in my heart

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,00
Changed my state of mind When love's so hard to find

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Your feelings changed like the weather

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Went from clear to gray

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
On that cloudy day

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How can I go on Without falling apart

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Love's so hard to find When someone's on your mind

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Listen baby
Your wish is my command

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Baby won't you understand

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That your wish is my command
What can I do to make my baby understand

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Something tells me that I'm dreaming

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I can see us there Waving unaware

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of problems that have a tendency to keep

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Keep the truth confined Far from our minds

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You need someone you can believe in

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This I do declare Trust me I'll be there

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,00
I will help you climb Change your state of mind

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Listen baby

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Your wish is my command

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Baby won't you understand

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That your wish is my command

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What can I do to make my baby understand

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Your wish is my command

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Baby won't you understand

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That your wish is my command

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can see us there Waving unaware

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This I do declare Trust me I'll be there

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can see us there Waving unaware

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This I do declare Trust me I'll be there

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can see us there Waving unaware

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This I do declare Trust me I'll be there

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Listen baby

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Your wish is my command

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Baby won't you understand

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That your wish is my command

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What can I do to make my baby understand

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Follow me into, into my sleep

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Baby I'm yours, I'm yours to keep

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You've got the magic That entered my heart and my mind

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Your wish is my command

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Baby won't you understand Your wish is my command

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Baby won't you understand

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your wish is my command

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Baby won't you understand

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Good job!
