00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,000
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So much to do, so much to see

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You'll never know if you don't go

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You'll never shine if you don't glow

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And all that glitters is gold

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Only shooting stars break the mold

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But the meteor men beg to differ

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
My world's on fire, how about yours?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All that glitters is gold

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Only shooting stars break the mold

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And all that glitters is gold

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Only shooting stars

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I need to get myself away from this place

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I said yep what a concept

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I could use a little fuel myself

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And we could all use a little change

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So much to do, so much to see

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You'll never shine if you don't glow

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And all that glitters is gold

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Only shooting stars break the mold

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And all that glitters is gold

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Only shooting stars break the mold

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Great job!
