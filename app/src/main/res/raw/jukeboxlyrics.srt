1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:10,000
Get Ready!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Standing in the rain, with his head hung low

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He heard one guitar, just blew him away

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Bought a beat up six string, in a secondhand store

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That one guitar, felt good in his hands

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Didn't take long, to understand

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just one guitar, slung way down low

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So he started rockin', ain't never gonna stop

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Gotta keep on rockin', someday gonna make it to the top

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's a juke box hero

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He took one guitar (juke box hero, stars in his eyes)

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Juke box hero, (stars in his eyes) he'll come alive tonight

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And that one guitar, made his whole life change

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now he needs to keep on rockin', he just can't stop

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, juke box hero, stars in his eyes

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
With that one guitar (stars in his eyes)

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He'll come alive, come alive tonight, woah

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, he's gotta keep on rockin', just can't stop

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
(Just one guitar) juke box hero, got stars in his eyes

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
How he's just a juke box hero, aah aah aah

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Juke box (stars) hero, (stars, stars) juke box hero, (stars, stars)

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's got stars in his eyes, stars in his eyes
