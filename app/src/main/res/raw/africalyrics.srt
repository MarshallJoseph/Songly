1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:31,000
Get Ready

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I hear the drums echoing tonight

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
She's coming in, 12:30 flight

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I stopped an old man along the way

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:1:26,000
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:1:31,000
I bless the rains down in Africa

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:1:43,000
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:1:54,000
The wild dogs cry out in the night

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I know that I must do what's right

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I bless the rains down in Africa

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I bless the rains down in Africa

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I bless the rains down in Africa

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
(I bless the rain)

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rain)

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I bless the rains down in Africa

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I bless the rains down in Africa (ah, gonna take the time)

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Good job!
